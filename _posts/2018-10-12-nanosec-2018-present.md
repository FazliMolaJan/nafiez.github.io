October 10, me and my buddy present at NanoSec Conference Kuala Lumpur with topic "Exploitation Era: Past, Present and Future". It was awesome conference where you have chances to meet peoples and gather with local security community.

Slide materials has been shared by the organizer https://www.nanosec.asia/nsc18-materials/.

Please note that we have to remove some of the 'fancy' stuff from the slide. We'll be sharing more information once everything fine. You can find our slide at NanoSec site:
