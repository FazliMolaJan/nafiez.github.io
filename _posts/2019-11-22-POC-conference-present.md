Early this month (November 2019), me and my buddy (Jaan Yeh) presented at Power Of Community (POC) Conference in Seoul with topic "Hunting Vulnerability of Antivirus product". Its a great conference and we recommend you to attend. Helpful and friendly crews, great hospitalities, awesome food and soju (not me for Yeh only LOL~). We looking forward to visit Seoul again!
